### Double check you have the correct folder.
The mod folder you need to copy to the **Quest 2** will have a `manifest` or `manifest.json` file inside it such as `CoolMod/manifest.json`.

```warning
If you have a folder that looks like `CoolMod-865-1-0-164277211` then that folder is incorrect, you want the `CoolMod` folder inside it, not the one with lots of numbers on it.
```

### Plug the Quest 2 into the PC
Plug in the USB C cable into the Quest 2 and into your PC or Laptop you downloaded the mod onto.

there will be a notification asking you to `Allow access to data`. 
This will let your PC or Laptop access your Quest 2's files.

Select **Allow**
