## Json Changes

### Handle Poses

`handPoseId` and `overrideHandPose` has been removed from the Interactables section

### Previews

"closeUpIconAddress": "Path.to.my.Icon"
```

### Category

This has changed to a simple field

To help mass change your categories, you can use notepad++
and this regex to find and replace to fix your json category

find : `^\s*"categoryPath": \[\s*("[a-zA-Z0-9 ]+")\s*]`

replace: `"category": $1`

Make sure you check `Regular expresssion` AND `. matches newline`
you can do `Find in files` in notepad++ to do it for all the jsons
