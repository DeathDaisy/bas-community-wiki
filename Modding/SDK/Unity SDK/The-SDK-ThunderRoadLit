# The ThunderRoad/Lit Shader
## Texture Maps
The ThunderRoad/Lit shader uses different texture maps than Unity's built-in Universal Rendering Pipeline(URP) shader. The Base Color and the Normal Map are the same, but the MOES is different. 
### Base Color 

### Normal Map

### MOES
MOES stands for Metallic(M) Occlusion(O) Emissive(E) Smoothness(S). What it does is map those parameters into separate color channels in one single image; Red Green Blue Alpha(RGBA) respectively. 
This saves video memory compared to having each as a separate image which is the case in the URP shader. Think of the MOES texture as four separate grayscale channels rather than the combined color image.
